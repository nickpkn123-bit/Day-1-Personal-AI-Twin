Personal Agent Twin - A simple CrewAI example for students
============================================================

This script creates an AI agent that acts as your "digital twin" - 
an agent that knows about you and can answer questions on your behalf.

Students: Edit the BACKSTORY section to create your own personal agent!

Here's what you know about me:
- I'm a student at CUHK studying AI agents and security
- I'm interested in scientific machine learning and computational physics
- I'm currently working on NANDA A2A agent trust-handshake systems
- My favorite programming language is Python
- I enjoy Chinese political history and broad intellectual topics
